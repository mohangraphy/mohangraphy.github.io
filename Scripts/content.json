      "I am <strong>N C Mohan</strong>, a photographer based in India with a deep passion for capturing the world in its most honest and luminous moments. My work spans landscapes, wildlife, architecture, and the quiet beauty of everyday life.",
      "Photography for me is the intersection of <strong>light, moment, and story</strong> — three elements that are fleeting, unrepeatable, and endlessly compelling. I chase the quality of light as obsessively as I chase the subject within it.",
      "My journeys have taken me across India's diverse terrains — from the mist-laden hills of <strong>Megamalai</strong> of South to the <strong>Snow-cladden Himalayas</strong> of the North, the coastlines of West and East, the deserts of Rajasthan plains and high-altitude Ladakh, and the many forests that define this extraordinary country."
