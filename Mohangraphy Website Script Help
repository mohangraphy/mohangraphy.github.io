How to Run it from the new location
Since the script is now deeper in your folder structure, use these prompts:

Navigate to your new scripts folder:

Bash
cd /Users/ncm/Pictures/Mohangraphy/scripts

2) Activate your environment:

Bash
source ~/Desktop/snaowa_env/bin/activate

3) Run the script:

Bash
python3 build_mohangraphy.py

4) Via Terminal: Since you are already in the scripts folder, type this:

Bash
open ../index.html

5) How to Share it with the World (Hosting)
To make Mohangraphy accessible to everyone (like a real .com), you need to "push" these files to your GitHub repository.

6) Follow these prompts in your terminal:

Go to the main folder:

Bash
cd /Users/ncm/Pictures/Mohangraphy
Initialize the repository (if you haven't yet):

Bash
git init
Add your files:

Bash
git add .
Commit your changes:

Bash
git commit -m "Launch Mohangraphy Megamalai collection"
Link and Push: (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub name)

Bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mohangraphy.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

3. Utility Script: The "Auto-Update" Tool
Since you plan to "grow steadily," you’ll be running this process often. I’ve written a small "utility script" for you to save in your scripts folder. This script combines the site building and the GitHub uploading into one single command.

Save this as deploy.py in your Mohangraphy/scripts folder:

Moving to a custom domain like www.mohangraphy.com is a great move for your branding as a photographer. Since your site is hosted on GitHub Pages, the "hosting" remains free, but you will need to purchase the domain name itself (usually around ₹800–₹1200 per year).

Here is the process to link your GitHub site to your new domain.

Step 1: Buy the Domain
You can purchase mohangraphy.com from a registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains (Squarespace).

Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages
Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click Settings > Pages.

Under Custom Domain, type www.mohangraphy.com and click Save.

This will automatically create a file named CNAME in your repository.

Step 3: Update your DNS Records
Log in to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy) and find the DNS Management section. You need to add these records so the domain points to GitHub's servers:

1. The "A" Records (Point the naked domain mohangraphy.com to GitHub):
Add four A records with the host @ pointing to these IP addresses:

185.199.108.153

185.199.109.153

185.199.110.153

185.199.111.153

2. The "CNAME" Record (Point www to your GitHub URL):

Type: CNAME

Name (Host): www

Value (Target): YOUR_USERNAME.github.io

Step 4: Update your Python Script
Since GitHub adds a file named CNAME to your folder when you set a custom domain, we need to make sure your Python script doesn't accidentally delete it or ignore it when regenerating the site.

Update your build_mohangraphy.py by adding "CNAME" to the exclusion list.

Python
import os

# This looks for the parent folder of the 'scripts' folder
BASE_PATH = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
OUTPUT_FILE = os.path.join(BASE_PATH, "index.html")

def generate_mohangraphy():
    # ... (Keep the same CSS from the previous version) ...

    # UPDATED: We added 'CNAME' to the exclusion list so your domain settings stay safe
    categories = sorted([d for d in os.listdir(BASE_PATH) 
                        if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(BASE_PATH, d)) 
                        and d not in ["scripts", "CNAME"] 
                        and not d.startswith('.')])
    
    # ... (Rest of the script remains the same) ...

    with open(OUTPUT_FILE, "w") as f:
        f.write(full_html)
    print(f"Success! Website generated at: {OUTPUT_FILE}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_mohangraphy()
Final Checklist
Wait for DNS Propagation: It can take anywhere from 1 to 24 hours for the new domain to start working globally.

Enforce HTTPS: Once the domain is linked, go back to GitHub Settings > Pages and check the box for Enforce HTTPS. This gives your site the "Lock" icon in the browser, making it secure for visitors.

Would you like me to help you draft a professional "About Me" or "Contact" section to add to the bottom of the page once the domain is live?
