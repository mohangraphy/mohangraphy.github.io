Upgrade based on Vishruth's input:

Feb 28 - 11:00 pm

Level 1 - 2 columns are fine; however, for all other levels, 4 columns needed for laptops.
Footer need not be persistent and should be part of the website scroll.

For the individual images, remove the bar with the LIKE and SHOP icons. 

When user clicks on a particular image, it should open as a image details modal which displays the image in a bigger size and with the option of LIKE and REQUEST QUOTE. This replaces "BUY PRINT" used earlier.

After user clicks on Request Quote, I want to initiate a Request quote flow which has two steps: a) Select the Print size b) Contact Details (name and email). This is a Single Form

ON the left side menu, Combine About Me and Philosophy and Gear & Kit. Call it 

Combine Licensing and Copyright & Legal to the footer. Footer should not be a persistent UI element. Should be a part of the web page scroll at the bottom. 

Change of Header design.   Move Mohangraphy to left and reduce the size to a height of 20px. Use monospace San Serif font with a thin font weight to retain the premiumness. 

On the right edge of the header, keep a call to Action Button that says Get In Touch, which will redirect the user to the Get in Touch page. 

In the center of the Header, keep three tabs : 1st tab: Home (landing page, on active state when user is present on the landing page), 2nd tab : Collections (Drop Down Tab, which shows the four main categories: Architecture, People, Nature and Places. 3rd tab: About Me (redirects to the About Me page which will have the combined information from the current About Me, Philosophy and Gear & Kit

This means both the left side and right side menus are no longer needed.

First level of the page is the landing page.

Second level will be the individual collection pages - which have subcategories within them.

third level of pages will display the images. 

For example, Places card from the landing page which will take to second level page which will display a title and subtext about Places, below which there will be two filter pills National and International. Below this there will be cards for each category under National and International. Four cards to be fit into one row here. When a user clicks on a card, the card will expand to show the different categories within this State (in National category) or Country (International category). When a user clicks on a STate or Country, it will take them to level 3 pages with all the images displayed here.

For all the pages retain bread-crumb navigation displayed on the top of the page so that the user knows exactly where he is in the site. 

For mobile phones, where ever there are cards, they must be on single column to the width of the page.  

For Mobile phones, move all the four tab options in the Header should move to the Hamburger menu to the right. MOHANGRAPHY shall be centered and spaced according to Mobile phones

Upgrades

This is how the new website is appearing. None of the menus are working. Mohangraphy should be bigger , but the menu text must be the same as HOME and COLLECTIONS. They can also be near and not spread out and use that saved space to increase the size of Mohangraphy to 60px. 
Connect to the all the photos that were uploaded earlier. No change to the names of the subcategories. 
Also, the link to the analytics and editing tabs - all of that must be retained. Basically, the functions must remain except for the feature that have been removed.

=====

The main page is not showing the random photos that changes every 3 seconds.

When I land on a page, as shown above, I see the Home Button in three places. That looks very odd. Fix that.

Also, photos are not separated. Add separation.

When user clicks on a particular image, it should open as a image details modal which displays the image in a bigger size and with the option of LIKE and REQUEST QUOTE. This replaces "BUY PRINT" used earlier.

Also, ensure the link to supaspace.com is working and all likes are counted.

Similarly ensure link to Plausible.io is working and also ensure Google Analytics is connected and pulling the data and does not include my growing/revising the scripts.

I updated the content.json page. It is not getting pulled.

The old content.json page has several scripts which are not required. Can't we simply delete them if they are not applicable. Similarly delete what ever is not applicable from every script. For example - reference to Workshops in one of the scripts can be deleted so that the script is clean.
